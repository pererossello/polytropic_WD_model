# Lane-Emden Numerical Solver and Plotting Tool

This repository contains the code developed for an assignment for the 'Estructura y Evolución Estelar' class at the Universidad de La Laguna, specifically designed for the Master's degree in Astrophysics. It includes a numerical solver for the Lane-Emden equation and scripts for plotting relevant astrophysical data, such as mass, radius, and density profiles of white dwarfs (WDs).

## Description

The Lane-Emden equation is a dimensionless form of the Poisson equation for gravitational potentials that is used in the theory of stellar structure. This project involves numerically solving the Lane-Emden equation for different polytropic indices and using the solutions to compute various polytropic coefficients of a polytropic star. The coefficients are then used to derive the mass and radius of white dwarfs with varying central densities, including a model representative of the Sun in its terminal evolutionary stage.

## Features

- Numerical solver for the Lane-Emden equation using 4th order Runge-Kutta.
- Computation of polytropic coefficients \( M_n, R_n, D_n, B_n \).
- Generation of mass and radius profiles for non-relativistic WDs.
- Plotting scripts for visualizing the results in a clear and concise manner.
